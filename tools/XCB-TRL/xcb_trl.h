/* Why use this?
 * you shouldnt, this was mostly for self-documentation and for macros.
 * Why make this?
 * xcb snake_case is a dumb change (in my opinion), and should have stayed camelCase or PascalCase.
 * but it likely wasnt to "dissasociate" from Xlib which is fine, however I personally dont like that form of casing.
 * also some changes encourage a certain type of usage which is fine, however when "some things" are poorly documented.
 * It becomes quite hard to understand those design choices.
 * However for the most part the important things are documented.
 * Secondly the design choices really make xcb more like a Async Xlib which is strange.
 * Is this bloat?
 * Yes, yes it is.
 * Why not seperate files?
 * 1. Faster compiling.
 * 2. ctrl+f or '/' for search, no need for grep.
 * 3. too much work.
 * 4. I am Lazy.
 *
 * Main reason to not use xcb
 * 1.) Way harder to use to its asyncrounous nature
 * Really, Xlib's locking of Server is overblown out of proportion when talking about xcb being better.
 * The main problem though with Xlib is that it could be async (which would make xcb less useful) and most of the functions are.
 * HOWEVER some "vital" or imporant ones arent which is the main problem with Xlib.
 * Secondly Xlib uses quite a bit more resources than xcb which is also why xcb use often times "better" for the most part though Xlib is fine,
 * What really should happen is we build a toolkit around xcb and NOT use Xlib in the first place. AND not do what Xlib did and be syncrounous.
 * Which is what we did... 
 * However its a shame that Xlib is seen as "deprecated" by people how dont use the X11 windoing system. Really it be more accurate to be seen as a bandage fix
 * XCB if documented would have already take over Xlib and xlib would without question already been banished to the shadow realm.
 * However XCB still has a way to go without its documentation, though it has improved greatly over the years.

/*
 * Basic XCB Usage.
 *
 *
 * NOTE: This trl is NOT thread safe, instead one must manually lock the display for thread safety.
 * NOTE: These functions only LOCK the display NOT the current thread.
 * XCBLockDisplay();    // Analagous to pthread_mutex_lock
 * XCBUnlockDisplay();  // Analagous to pthread_mutex_unlock
 *
 *
 * xcb has a async way of handling stuff so when you call a function to do something async, unless you poll for reply nothing will happen.
 * This is because the item is buffered to itself meaning that unless you call XCBSync() or XCBFlush() you will never get your event back.
 * This is bad as it makes some things harder to use but its mostly good cause you can make a buffered requests and then just send that 1 big buffer.
 * This saves on time asking for ping backs for every single requests.
 * However do note that non-event type requests such as quering a windows attributes, cookies are sent immediatly to the XServer.
 * The Caveat with these is that you have to wait for the reply back. via the _reply() version of the functions.
 * Secondly with these if you never call for a _reply() of that cookie then you WILL leak memory. as you need to free 90% of the _reply() versions.
 *
 *
 *
 * <<< Event handling >>>
 *
 * XCB uses a rather unique approach to event handling which allows very little memory to be used rather an Xlib's simpler approach.
 *
 * This event handling basically is a just a simple structure with padding and id's;
 * XCBGenericEvent *ev;
 *
 * ev->pad;
 * ev->pad0;
 * ev->sequence;
 * ev->full_sequence;
 * ev->response_type;
 *
 * ev->pad              is where all the extra information is stored and allows for xcb to have little memory as this is where we store and cast other structures.
 * ev->pad0             is aligment padding
 * ev->sequence         is like the cookie id's so its mostly useless
 * ev->full_sequence    see above
 * ev->response_type    This is probably the most imporant part, and tells you what event you want.
 *
 * However you may notice that simply using ev->response_type yields access to very few events this is another part of xcb that allows for better memory control.
 * However because of that it is quite the inconvenient to use, there is a mask however provided by XCB that fixes this, a bit long for no reason too.
 *
 *
 * This is an example on how to use events 
 * <<< Events >>>
 *
 * 
 * #define DEBUG(fmt, ...) fprintf(stderr, "[%s:%d] by %s: " fmt "\n", __FILE__,__LINE__,__func__,__VA_ARGS__)
 * int screen;
 * XCBDisplay *dpy;
 *
 * // Open the display
 * dpy = XCBOpenDisplay(NULL, &screen);
 * // XCBOpenDisplay() returns NULL on failure.
 * if(!dpy)
 * {    printf("%s\n", "Failed to open display.");
 *      exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
 * }
 *
 *
 * 
 *
 * int running = 1;
 * uint8_t cleanev;
 * XCBGenericEvent *ev;
 *                  // XCBNextEvent returns 1, IF an I/O Errors occured, this more often than not this means the XServer died. Or we ran out of memory..
 *                  // Though linux will almost always prevent an out of memory error it could still happen.
 * while(running && !XCBNextEvent(dpy, &ev))
 * {
 *      // if ev->response_type is ever 0 then an error occured
 *      if(ev->response_type == 0)
 *      {
 *          printf("%s\n", "Woops we encountered an error exiting...");
 *          exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
 *      }
 *      // Back in the day you would do ev->response_type & ~0x80 however XCB changed this to a macro which is more typesafe
 *      // But what this does is allow use to use the first few bits as numbers
 *      // Let's just say it lets us use the response_type as enum.
 *      cleanev = XCB_EVENT_RESPONSE_TYPE(ev);
 *      // XCB Does NOT automatically free replies which is actually quite the pain to deal with but allows for more control over an application.
 *      // However you can discard certain replies, (mainly ones that return a cookie) using XCBDiscardReply(), which allows use to not need to free the reply,
 *      // but we dont get it back either, See the section "Self Spoofing"
 *      free(ev);
 *      // Technically you dont need to 'clean' the response_type for this function its just an example.
 *      printf("%s\n", XCBGetEventName(cleanev));
 *  }
 *
 * Cookies;
 *
 * Cookies are simply structures with ids.
 * These cookies are mostly useless and just ids for xcb to use.
 *
 * However you can do 2 unique things with them.
 *
 * Self Spoofing;
 *
 * Events in xcb are quite different compared to Xlib and are much simpler in theory.
 * Due to this we can self Spoof calls to our current event handler.
 * This is sometimes useful when you dont want to receive an event back (for whatever reason).
 * Or when you want to receive events back from yourself which can be useful most of the time.
 *
 * # This would send an event to the XServer that we want to map this window as a maprequest (assuming we sent it).
 * # and have to be handle by us.
 *
 * XCBMapWindow(dpy, cool_window);
 *
 * # <<< Event Generated >>> #
 *
 * However we can "spoof" no reply and generate no event for ourselves.
 *
 * XCBCookie cookie;
 * cookie = XCBMapWindow(dpy, cool_window);
 * XCBDiscardReply(dpy, cookie);
 *
 * # <<< No Event Generated >>> #
 *
 * This may not "always" work due to how xcb works so, we must to call XCBDiscardReply() after our generated cookie.
 * 
 * XCBCookie cookie;
 * cookie = XCBMapWindow(dpy, cool_window);
 * // Sync the Display
 * XCBSync(dpy) # or XCBFlush(dpy);
 *
 * # This does nothing because we flushed the buffer to the display using XCBSync()
 * XCBDiscardReply(dpy, cookie);
 *
 *
 * # Replies
 *
 * Simply put a reply is a 2 step container that holds what the information entails (info) (the first part).
 * And holds the actual data in the second part.
 *
 * Now both are technically the same thing, ie you only need to the free the "reply" (first part).
 *
 * Lets first start with Usual no data replies, these are replies which are just small enough to fit into 1 structure.
 *
 * // Example 1
 *
 * // Here we have a empty unfilled reply.
 * // Lets get a reply back.
 *
 * XCBGetWindowAttributes *wa = NULL;
 *
 * // Open display.
 * int screen = 0;
 * XCBDisplay *display = XCBOpenDisplay(NULL, &screen);
 * if(!display)
 * {    // display refused to open. May there is no XServer Active?
 *      exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
 * }
 *
 * // This is just a example target you can use any window ID you want.
 * const XCBWindow target = XCBRootWindow(display, screen);
 *
 *
 * XCBCookie cookie = XCBGetWindowAttributesCookie(display, target);
 *
 * // wait for the reply (this blocks the current thread and waits for a server reply back)s
 *
 * wa = XCBGetWindowAttributesReply(display, cookie);
 *
 * // Check if there was no reply, (Did we pass in the wrong data? Is the window already destroyed?)
 * if(!wa)
 * {    
 *      // In this case we simply remove our XServer connection and exit, 
 *      // but often times you assume the window doesnt have attributes, or a bug in your code.
 *      XCBCloseDisplay(display);
 *      exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
 * }
 * // else we got a window attribute back.
 *
 * // as you can see the Window attribute has all the data by itself, which is good as no other data was also allocated after.
 * wa->_class;
 * // Now this part is useless, but is "pad" in other words every reply has these, and is what we use as spare bits for extra data.
 * wa->pad0[0];
 * wa->pad0[1];
 *
 * // free resulting data.
 * free(wa);
 * 
 * // Example 2.
 *
 * // Here we will get the WM_NAME of a window if set.
 *
 * #define NO_BYTE_OFFSET               (0L)
 * #define REQUEST_MAX_NEEDED_ITEMS     (UINT32_MAX)
 * 
 * // See Xlib documentation for what these fields indicate.
 * XCBCookie  wmcookie = XCBGetWindowPropertyCookie(display, target, XCB_ATOM_WM_NAME, NO_BYTE_OFFSET, REQUEST_MAX_NEEDED_ITEMS, False, XCB_ATOM_STRING);
 * 
 * // Here we wait again for the reply to come back from the XServer.
 * XCBWindowProperty *prop = XCBGetWindowPropertyReply(display, wmcokie);
 * 
 * // First we check if the prop exists, in this case probably no because the target is the root window, 
 * // but if we used a actual window then we would get something back.
 *
 * if(!prop)
 * {    // no prop.
 *      XCBCloseDisplay(display);
 *      exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
 * }
 * // But if we did get a prop back then the window probably has the WM_NAME atleast configured, not necessarily set though.
 * int32_t offset = 0;
 * // This gets how big it is in bytes. Relative to the specified format which should be 8 (as this is a string).
 * XCBGetPropertyValueSize(prop, &offset);
 * char *str = XCBGetPropertyValue(prop);
 *
 * // Now technically you could just do nothing here and use this as it is, because this is now YOUR memory.
 * // But that would be somewhat memory inefficient.
 *
 * // Check if has value, or if the offset says 0, because that indicates how long our memory is for the value.
 * if(!str || !offset)
 * {    
 *      // In this case the target window did not have a WM_NAME net.
 *      XCBCloseDisplay(display);
 *      exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
 * }
 * // Print out the string, and hope its null-terminating.
 * printf("%s\n", str);
 *
 * // Now the actually handle the "string".
 * size_t sizeofstring = sizeof(char) * offset;     // strlen() of string.
 * size_t sizeofnullbyte = sizeof(char);            // nullbyte -> '\0'
 * size_t fullsize = sizeofstring + sizeofnullbyte;
 * char *newstring = malloc(fullsize);
 * if(!newstring)
 * {    // We failed to malloc memory, this is not covered by this example.
 *      XCBCloseDisplay(display);
 *      exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
 * }
 * memcpy(newstring, str, offset);
 * // Yes technically you can just do memset with 0, but no this is more clear.
 * memcpy(newstring + offset, "\0", sizeofnullbyte);
 *
 * // Now we have a fully save string that doesnt inclued extra padding.
 *
 * // And we free the prop, this includes the info in XCBGetWindowAttributes *prop,
 * // And the data we got, XCBGetPropertyValue(prop), or "str" in this case.
 *
 * // Here is how it would look like. (Not To Scale).
 * // As you can see the whole thing really is just 1 big 'o block of memory, 
 * // which is why we only need to free(prop), because of being the start of the chunk of memory.
 * // Now dont be silly and free the data, because that is quite hard to debug, I would know (it isnt).
 * // What it does do is leave a dangling pointer, which is equally bad.
 *
 * XCBWindowProperty *prop;            | void *data = XCBGetPropertyValue(prop);
 * 01010100 00110010 00000000 01000110   00011100 11001111 00110010 01010100 
 *
 * free(prop);
 *
 * // And were done with (most) props.
 * XCBCloseDisplay(display);
 * return EXIT_SUCCESS;
 *
 * # Reply64
 * # This really isnt too important as unless your doing some very specific things.
 * XCBDiscardReply64(dpy, cookie);
 *
 * Reply backs;
 *
 * The second thing we can do is ask for a reply back from the XServer.
 * This can be done manually using _XReply(), _XRead(), _XWrite() however xcb abstracts that away.
 * Because of that we can use xcb_cool_function_ and then _reply() so xcb_cool_function_reply(XCBDisplay *display, XCBCookie cookie);
 * Some xcb functions dont have a _reply() version and those are simply handled in the event queue;
 * 
 * Errors;
 *
 * Depending on the type of error a few things can occur.
 *
 * <<< XCBConnection Error >>> ;
 * This type of error can happen out of the blue if you arent careful.
 * To check if this error occured simply acces the display->has_error type;
 * If you want a more clear approach you can simply call XCBHasConnectionError();
 *
 * <<< Reply Errors >>> ;
 * By default Errors are handled in the event queue.
 * However reply backs, (ie any function that calls for a reply from a cookie).
 * Instead uses the XCBErrorHandler(), this can be set by the client using XCBSetErrorHandler().
 * By Default however we call die() on extension errors and so nothing on know errors that can be ignored.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * # Decorations ;
 *
 * <<< Server Sided decorations >>> ;
 *
 * Some window manager may imply "decorations" and/or titlebar(s) to your windows.
 * You can "ask" most "modern" window managers to disable them using motif hints.
 *
 * <<< Client side decorations >>> ;
 * By default these are always disabled, however one can enable them as a window manager using the enviroment variable GTK_CSD.
 * Simply by setting it to any value it should enable them for gtk windows if they support it.
 * see: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GTK#Client-side_decorations
 *
 * TODO: Maybe show docu for Qt5?
